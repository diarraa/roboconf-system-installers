The sources for system installers.  
This includes Linux scripts, Debian packages, etc.
  
They are located in a different Git repository because for a given version of Roboconf,
there may be several released installers. Said differently, fixing something in an installer
does not mean the binaries (e.g. the platform) have to be changed.
